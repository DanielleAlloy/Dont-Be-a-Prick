      <h1>Dealing with Pests</h1>
      <h4>If you’re growing succulents indoors (and possibly if you’re growing succulents outdoors), you are likely to encounter mealybugs at some point. If not, lucky you! Mealybugs are like a plague. </h4>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xl-6">
          <h2>What are mealybugs?</h2>
          <p> Mealybugs are nasty little bugs that like to eat new growth on succulents. It’s difficult to say exactly what causes them to show up, but overwatering is a common cause, as well as over fertilizing. They tend to show up on indoor plants the most as the temperatures are more temperate, but they can show up on succulents outdoors too! </p>
          <p>These little guys usually hang out in a white web-like substance in the nooks and crannies of your succulent. Their favorite place to hide is right where the leaves meet up with the stem. This makes them hard to see and hard to kill. </p>
          <p>If they aren’t treated quickly, mealybugs will spread all over a succulent and to nearby succulents as well. It’s impressive how quickly they move, and frustrating too. As they move, they eat away at the succulent. Often, this will stunt the growth of the plant and cause the new growth to look mis-shaped or smaller than usual. They may also leave some dents in the leaves if they are left for too long.</p>

          <h2 class="float-right waterTopPadding">How can I get rid of mealybugs? </h2>
          <p class="float-right">The video to the left shows the technique I use to get rid of mealybugs from succulents using isopropyl alcohol. You can also read the details of this method in the sections that follow. </p>
          <p class="float-right">While many plant pesticides will kill mealybugs, the best solution I’ve found to kill them is 70% isopropyl alcohol. Many people recommend using q-tips to dab on the alcohol, but I’ve found that a spray bottle is much more effective and easier to use. I actually keep a little travel sized spray bottle next to my plants so I can kill the nasty things as soon as they show up. I do use a larger one if the infestation gets out of hand or affects very many plants. When you first notice the mealybugs, move your infected plants away from everything else. Mealybugs spread quickly and you don’t want to risk other plants getting infected. </p>
          <p class="float-right">To kill the mealybugs with the alcohol, simply spray the alcohol directly on the mealybugs, wherever they are on the succulent.Be sure to check those hard to see places near the stem. Spray them really well with the alcohol. You’ll notice the web-like substance will almost disappear as soon as you spray them and a little brownish/black bug, the size of a crumb will be left.</p>
