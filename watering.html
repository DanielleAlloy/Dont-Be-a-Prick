      <h1>How do I water my succulents and Cacti?</h1>
      <h4>There are three common mistakes that most people make when watering succulents and cacti. Follow the tips on this page and watch your plants thrive.</h4>

          <h2>Using a pot without drainage holes</h2>
          <p>Although your succulents can survive in planters without drainage holes, you’ll have to put in a lot more work to keep them happy. The easiest way to keep your succulents happy is to purchase a pot that already contains drainage holes, but you can also add your own drainiage holes.</p>
          <p>To add drainage holes to a metal pot, you can use a nail to poke holes. Adding holes to a plastic pot is easy, and can be done using nails or a standard drill bit. You would use a masonry drill bit to add drainage holes to an unglazed ceramic or cement pot. Glazed ceramic pots tend to be the most difficult, and can only be done with a diamond tipped drill bit. It takes a good bit of time and force, but is very effective. </p>

          <h2 class="float-right waterTopPadding">Using Poorly Draining Soil</h2>
          <p class="float-right">The right soil is a huge part of successfully watering your succulents. In general, a good soil will have a 50/50 soil to filler ratio. Some succulents &amp; cacti prefer more or less soil. Check your plant's water requirements before planting.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="float-right">The bottom line is that succulents prefer not to sit in wet soil for very long. So in addition to getting a pot that drains effectively, you’ve got to use soil that does the same.</p>

          <h2 class="float-left waterTopPadding">Using a spray bottle for watering</h2>
          <p class="clearLeft">Succulents like to be soaked, not spritzed! I’ve had so many people tell me they use a spray bottle for watering succulents–and every time I hear that, instantly I know why their plants are struggling. Don’t do it! There is only time I recommend using a spray bottle for succulents and that is when propagarting succulent cuttings and clipping. So what should you use to water your plants? </p>
          <p> A small watering can works great! My watering can has a rather long spout, so I can water in between my succulent plants rather than on top of them–plus it holds just enough water for me to soak two or three pots indoors. I also have a larger watering can that I use outside, or sometimes I’ll just use a hose with a soft sprayer attachment. All these tools work great</p>

          <h2 class="float-right clearRight waterTopPadding">How to Water Succulents Indoors</h2>
          <p class="float-right clearRight">The best way to water succulents is to completely soak the soil and then let it dry out completely before you water again. I call this the Soak and Dry watering method. </p>
          <p class="float-right">When you water your succulents, you want to make sure the soil is completely soaked. When the soil is soaked, your succulents will soak up as much water as they can. Then wait for the soil to dry out completely – all the way to the bottom -before you water again. In fact, your succulents will do fine in completely dry soil for several days, especially if they’re larger and have well-established roots. During the “drought,” they’ll put out new roots that are thick and healthy, so they can absorb more water when the “flood” comes again.</p>
          <p class="float-right">Watch the video to the left for a full description of the soak and dry method and other tips for watering indoor succulents. </p>
